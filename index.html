                <p>Jack of many trades, master of some.</p>

                <p>15+ years of experience building and scaling tech products across consumer and enterprise, with deep focus on product, partnerships, growth, and user experience.</p>

                <p>Currently the Co-founder & CEO at TaskGenie, where we‚Äôre building <a href="https://robinhome.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Robin">Robin</a> an AI-powered household assistant that helps urban working families reclaim their time and peace of mind by handling life‚Äôs everyday admin.</p>

                <p>Previously, I led partnerships at Netflix India, driving strategic acquisition and distribution deals with Jio, Airtel, ACT, and Tata Play. Before that, I held product roles at Microsoft and Disney+ Hotstar.</p>

                <p>I‚Äôm drawn to opportunities that combine high learning curves with large-scale impact. I love building products that solve real problems and delight users.</p>

                <h3>My values</h3>
                <p>Identifying my personal values has been liberating and focusing. It allows me to assess if my actions, my choices, my decisions are in alignment with my values and when I find situations where they are misaligned, it forces me to consider whether I am being deliberate and thoughtful in deviating from those values or if these values are in conflict with what maybe the right thing to have done in certain circumstances. That self-reflection contributes to personal growth.</p>
                <p>Disclaimer: The following are not values I claim to exemplify, rather values that I aspire to live by.</p>

                <h4>Courage</h4>
                <p>More specifically, emotional courage. Courage to challenge, particularly when it‚Äôs uncomfortable. Courage to be comfortable being challenged. Courage to be candid, despite the discomfort. Courage to admit my mistakes. Courage to own up to my failures. Courage to be disliked. Courage to be unpopular when faced with the choice of being popular vs being honest. Courage to be vulnerable. Courage to step into the arena. Courage to admit, I don‚Äôt know.</p>

                <h4>Curiosity</h4>
                <p>Curiosity has driven (and continues to drive) humankind forward. In contemporary times, when Jeff Bezos advocates for wandering, or Steve Jobs advices students to  ‚ÄúStay hungry, stay foolish‚Äù or Reid Hoffman prescribes being ‚ÄúInfinite Learners‚Äù, or Satya Nadella emphasises on growth mindset in ‚ÄúHit Refresh‚Äù as part of the cultural transformation at Microsoft (inspired by Carol Dweck‚Äôs work on that topic), the common cultural value that binds those pursuits together is curiosity. Persistent and active pursuit of your curiosity is tiring, even overwhelming, but it can be extremely rewarding to personal and professional growth. There are no proverbial swimlanes in the sea of curiosity.</p>

                <h4>Compassion</h4>
                <p>Compassion, for me, has been an active, deliberative, conscious attempt at empathizing and resolving to help others (and myself). That can feel disingenuous, since one expects to be naturally compassionate (or not) without being deliberate about it. I do believe some (bounded) cognitive empathy is essential to being compassionate and research suggests that the foundation of empathy is built early in life. So, this has personally been the hardest value for me to practice (late in adulthood). I believe compassion is essential to being emotionally courageous.</p>
